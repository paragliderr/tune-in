# Tune-In 🎶

**Tune-In** is a social platform built around pop culture, hobbies, and shared interests — a place where people can discover, discuss, and connect over what they love.

The project is currently in active development and focuses on building a strong, scalable foundation before rolling out user-facing features.

## 🌍 What is Tune-In?

Tune-In aims to be a community-driven platform where users can:

- Create accounts and manage profiles
- Engage around hobbies, pop culture, and interests
- Connect with like-minded people
- Share and discover content in focused communities

Rather than being a generic social network, Tune-In is designed to revolve around **interests first**.

## 🧱 Current State

The project currently includes:

- Backend API built with FastAPI
- Authentication system (register & login)
- Database integration (PostgreSQL)
- Structured backend architecture ready for scaling
- Frontend and backend aligned at the project level
- Ai and Machine Learning models to build user behaviour and suggestions aligning with  similar users.

This stage is about **getting the core right**.
